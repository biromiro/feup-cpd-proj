## Pre-requisites

Java 18 or above should be installed in your machine.

## Compilation

##### In order to compile the source code, please run the following commands from the `src` folder:

To compile the server:

```
$ javac Store.java -d ../out
```

To compile the test client:

```
$ javac TestClient.java -d ../out
```

## Execution

### Server

In order to start a single node, please run the following command from the `out` folder, created after compilation:
```
$ java Store <IP_mcast_addr> <IP_mcast_port> <node_id>  <Store_port>
```
where:
- `<IP_mcast_addr>` is the address of the IP multicast group used by the membership service
- `<IP_mcast_port>` is the port number of the IP multicast group used by the membership service
- `<node_id>` is the node's id and it must be unique in a cluster (ideally, it would be the IP address)
- `<Store_port>` is the port number used by the storage service

### Client

In order to start a client and execute commands on the cluster nodes, please run the following command from the `out` folder, created after compilation:
```
$ java TestClient <node_ap> <operation> [<opnd>]
```
where:
- `<node_ap>` is the node's access point. For the membership operations, `<node_ap>` should be `<IP address>:<IP address>`, while for the remaining operations `<node_ap>` should be `<IP address>:<port number>`, where `<IP address>` and `<port number>` are respectively the IP address and the port number being used by the node
- `<operation>` is the string specifying the operation the node must execute. It can be either a key-value operation, i.e. "put", "get" or "delete", or a membership operation, i.e. "join" or "leave
- `[<opnd>]`is the argument of the operation. It is used only for key-value operations. In the case of:
  - put
    -  is the file pathname of the file with the value to add
  - otherwise (get or delete)
    -  is the string of hexadecimal symbols encoding the sha-256 key returned by put, as described in the next section.
